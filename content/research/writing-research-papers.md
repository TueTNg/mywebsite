This note is my synthesis on advice and tips for writing good papers in economics and finance that I have been reading and collecting over years. Please feel free to copy this post, but give some credit to me. This is a test for abstract only.

This is a new paragraph in the abstract section. Don’t assume if your your paper has good ideas, people will read it no matter how well or badly it was written.

A good paper should be simple, clear, and coherent, but to achieve this is not an easy task. It requires a lot of drafting, revision, and correction. It may take you a long time (may be many months) to produce your first *acceptable* paper.

## General advice

### Organize it well

Develop a good structure for your paper so that the readers can easily grasp the main ideas, navigate the important definitions and assumptions, and understand the key findings without having to read the whole wall of text. Reading scientific papers is not like reading novels. You normally don't proceed in a linear way: reading straight from beginning to end. Rather, you scan for results, look around for the explanation of terms and concepts you cannot guess, and see if the paper is really what you're looking for. You don't want to play hide-and-seek with information, and neither do your audience.

Don’t assume if your your paper has good ideas, people will read it no matter how well or badly it was written. People have limited time and brain power while having an abundance of alternatives (other papers). If they don’t see at their first glance that they will gain enough benefit from reading your paper, they will not proceed any further.

### Keep it short and concise 

Unnecessarily lengthy paper. Cut out unnecessary stuff, use simpler words and phrases. 

### Don't enumerate. Tell stories

While presenting your work, it may be useful to briefly explain how you arrived at your discoveries such as ideas, models, or formulas. It's better than throwing *came-from-middle-of-nowhere* stuff at your audience.

### Show your originality

Show what in your paper is different from previous studies or has not accomplished before. After all, all scientific works boil down to contributing something new to humankind's knowledge. If there's nothing *(significantly)* new in your paper, then it's not a scientific work.

### Use simple words

Whenever possible, try to avoid using complicated explanation. An article with full of eye-bleeding formulas and jargons may create an impression of professionalism, but may also prevent it from being popular.



## Structure of a scientific paper

A scientific paper in economics and business often consists of the following components (and often in the same presented order). Note that the items in square brackets are optional.

1. Title
2. Abstract
3. [Acknowledgement]
4. Introduction
5. Literature review
6. Data
7. Method
8. Conclusion
9. Bibliography
10. References

### Title

The title should be as descriptive and closely tied to your paper's content as possible. Normally, titles announce the subjects, but sometimes they describe the results. For example:

1. On the Number of Equilibria in Two-Person Games *(indicates the subject)*
2. Generic 4X4 Two Person Games Have at Most 15 Nash Equilibria *(describes the result)*

The title can take on the form of a statement or question. You can choose to go with either one, but not both in your title. For example: 

1. Rich people tend to be more aggressive *(statement)*
2. Does poor people tend to be more aggressive? *(question)*

### Abstract
